# TailGotchi

## Project Summary

Tailgotchi is an interactive app designed to make dog care fun and collaborative. It helps pet owners stay on top of their dog's care routine by offering a personalised, engaging platform to track essential tasks like feeding, walking, grooming, and vet appointments.

With the added twist of collaboration, Tailgotchi allows users to create and share their pet profiles with family members, roommates, or caretakers - so everyone involved can stay on the same page.

Tailgotchi turns routine dog care into a fun and rewarding experience. Owners can set up schedules, receive helpful reminders, and track their dog's progress with fun animations and interactive elements. Whether at home, work, or on vacation, you'll never have to worry about missing an important task.
